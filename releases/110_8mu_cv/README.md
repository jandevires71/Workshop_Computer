# 8mu CV

*A Music Thing [8mu](https://www.musicthing.co.uk/8mu.html) as four voltages and two pulses.*

A program card for the Music Thing Modular Workshop System Computer. Plug an
8mu into the Computer's front USB-C jack and its eight lefthand faders and
four top buttons become:

| 8mu control | Jack | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Fader 1** | Audio Out 1 | Voltage, centre = 0V (or LFO rate) |
| **Fader 2** | Audio Out 2 | Voltage, centre = 0V (or LFO rate) |
| **Fader 3** | CV Out 1 | Voltage, centre = 0V (or LFO rate) |
| **Fader 4** | CV Out 2 | Voltage, centre = 0V (or LFO rate) |
| **Fader 5** | Pulse Out 1 | Rate, 0.1Hz to 20Hz |
| **Fader 6** | Pulse Out 2 | Rate, 0.1Hz to 20Hz |
| **Fader 7** | Pulse Out 1 | Width, centre is a 50% square |
| **Fader 8** | Pulse Out 2 | Width, centre is a 50% square |
| **Button 1** (C2) | Audio Out 1 | Arm/disarm its triangle LFO |
| **Button 2** (C3) | Audio Out 2 | Arm/disarm its triangle LFO |
| **Button 3** (C4) | CV Out 1 | Arm/disarm its triangle LFO |
| **Button 4** (C5) | CV Out 2 | Arm/disarm its triangle LFO |

The Computer's own knobs are deliberately **not** a fallback: this card exists
to drive the 8mu's controls, so the 8mu's faders are the only thing that sets
the eight parameters. The one panel control that is used is the Main knob,
which sets LFO depth (see below), and the switch, which picks the mode.

The audio outputs are DC-coupled on this hardware, so they carry a steady
voltage just as well as sound does. That is what makes four voltage outputs
possible from two audio jacks and two CV jacks, rather than the usual two.
None of them are calibrated, which does not matter here: this card is a source
of control voltages, not a pitch reference.

## Modes

The Computer's switch picks what the card does:

| Switch | Mode | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| **Middle** | Basic | Faders 1-4 are steady voltages, 5-8 pulse rate and width |
| **Up** | LFO | Armed outputs oscillate; un-armed outputs stay steady voltages |
| **Down** (momentary) | Basic | Held, it re-takes the four LFO centres from the fader levels |

Switching back to Middle stops any oscillation, and each output glides to its
captured centre rather than jumping.

**Hold the switch down** to move all four LFO centres to wherever the faders
currently are - the way to set a new centre by hand.

## The voltages

Each of the four voltage outputs follows its fader from about -5V at the
bottom, through 0V in the middle, to about +5V at the top. The voltage is
smoothed very slightly, so the steps in the 8mu's 7-bit faders do not click
into whatever the voltage is controlling.

Use them for offsets, for holding a filter or oscillator at a position, or as
a manual voltage source you can dial in by hand.

## LFOs

Any of the four voltage outputs can be a **triangle LFO** instead of a steady
voltage. A tap on one of the four top buttons **arms** that output; it
oscillates whenever the switch is Up. You can arm in Middle and flip Up to
hear it.

Arming captures the voltage the output is already sitting at as the centre to
oscillate around, and while it is oscillating the fader that set the level
instead sets the **speed** (0.1Hz to 20Hz, exponential, the same feel as the
pulse rates). So the move is: dial in a voltage, tap the button, flip Up, and
it comes alive around that point while your finger takes over the rate.

A fader whose output is **not** armed is still a level even in LFO mode, so
the card stays useful with one LFO running or none.

**Main** sets how far the triangle swings: fully anticlockwise is no swing,
fully clockwise is the whole distance to the nearer supply rail. Because the
swing is measured to the rail, it scales itself down as the centre gets close
to one - an LFO can never clip, whatever the centre and depth are. Main only
affects armed outputs.

Disarming an output - by tapping its button again, or by dropping the switch
back to Middle - glides it to its centre. The fader does not grab the level
immediately, because it is sitting at a rate position; it stays locked until
you move it to meet the captured value, so nothing jumps.

**Holding any one of the four buttons for a second and a half disarms all four
at once** - the quick way to stop everything.

Arming survives the 8mu being unplugged; the mode is the switch's, so the card
always has a way back to steady voltages.

## The pulses

Pulse Out 1 and Pulse Out 2 are independent pulse streams. Fader 5 and fader 6
set their rates between 0.1Hz and 20Hz, with an exponential response so that
equal movements of the fader multiply the rate by the same amount. That matches
the way speed is heard: the bottom of the fader is a slow blink, the top is a
fast pulse.

Fader 7 and fader 8 set their **width** - how much of each cycle the output
stays high. The middle of the fader is a 50% square, the way up widens it and
the way down narrows it:

| Fader 7 / 8 | Duty | What it is good for |
|---|---|---|
| Bottom (~2%) | very narrow | a sharp trigger or clock edge |
| Middle (50%) | square | the classic LFO / gate shape |
| Top (~98%) | very wide | a gate that holds a note or envelope open nearly all the time |

The width never quite reaches zero or full, so there is always a pulse being
produced and never a dead or stuck output. Like the voltages, the width is
smoothed slightly, so sweeping the fader does not stretch a single pulse as it
passes.

Width comes from the 8mu alone - there is no other source for the eight
parameters, so with no controller attached both widths hold wherever they
were last left.

Patch them into clocks, triggers, gates, or anything that wants a rhythmic
on/off. At the bottom they are slow enough to use as an LFO; widen the pulses
for trigger duties and narrow-shape them into gate streams.

## Without a controller

Unplug the 8mu and the outputs simply hold their last values - nothing new can
be set, but nothing jumps either. The switch still selects the mode, so an
armed output can still be stopped from the panel. Plug it back in and the
faders pick up where they were.

## Panel LEDs

| LED | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | Lit while an 8mu is connected |
| 1 | Brightness follows the audio-out voltage on fader 1 |
| 2 | Follows Pulse Out 1 |
| 3 | Follows Pulse Out 2 |
| 4 | Lit in LFO mode (switch up) |
| 5 | Brightness follows the CV-out voltage on fader 3 |

## Requirements

The 8mu is a USB device, so the Computer has to act as a USB host: this needs
a **Rev 1.1 or later** board, and nothing else may be plugged into the
Computer's front USB socket. The card is a pure MIDI listener - it never
writes to the 8mu's LEDs or settings, so the controller behaves exactly as it
does anywhere else.

## Building

```bash
cmake -B build -G Ninja
cmake --build build
```

Drag `build/8mu_cv.uf2` onto the Pico in bootloader mode, or use the binary
committed at `UF2/8mu_cv.uf2`.
